This is the _FoodBox_ project. A proof of concept project similar to Loot Boxes in games, but for order food. Created with the solely purpose of improving my ReactJS skills.

In _FoodBox_ you can create boxes with a maximum value, and you can create many combinations with foods that you like from every available restaurants. When you get hungry, just purchase a closed box, and you will receive in your door a random box of food based on what you have previous choosed.

> This is a **proof of concept** product that I'm doing to practice developing with ReactJS, it will not work as a final product to deploy and use. But feel free to use any source code from here.

> This project was started after the SkipTheDishes / VanHack recruiting fair in SÃ£o Paulo, base on my project that I did there.
